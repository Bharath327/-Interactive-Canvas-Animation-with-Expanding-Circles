# -Interactive-Canvas-Animation-with-Expanding-Circles
This project creates an interactive canvas animation with circles that move randomly and expand when near the cursor. Using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, 500 circles bounce around the screen, changing size based on mouse proximity. The animation loop ensures smooth movement and dynamic resizing, offering a visually engaging experience.
